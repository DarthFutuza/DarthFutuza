- ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, Iâ€™m Futuza.  I'm a big Star Wars nerd and enjoy making software, automating the boring parts of life, and creating new things.

- I mostly work with C++, C, Lua, and Python though I also use other languages when practical, necessary, or when it sounds interesting.  For example, I've used Bash, Basic, Batch, C#, CMake, D, LC-3 (assembly), Java, Javascript, PHP, Powershell, Prolog, SQL, X86 Assembly, and YAML are all languages I've worked with before.
- One of my hobbies is working on [Jedi Knight Galaxies](https://www.jkgalaxies.net/) in my spare time, a multiplayer mod for the game Jedi Academy written in (mostly) C++.  Games are a lot of fun to develop and I've made a few over the years.  I lead a team of four while in University, making a game of our own design during the semester using Unity, in which the player takes the role of a pet tarantula in a first person shooter, tower defense style game.  I've also dabbled with Unreal Engine, CryEngine, and a few others to prototype and learn the new technologies emerging in the industry.  
- I enjoy a lot of different topics relating to computer science and my brain is always tickled learning about clever new solutions to the field and life itself.  Computer networking is fascinating and its sometimes a marvel that the internet works at all!  I've always been interested in computer security, encryption, and have spent about a decade working in the information technology field.  Malware analysis is also another past time of mine.
- I'm a fan of 2d animation, and occasionally dabble in making my own imitations of the great.  It's painstaking work, and has given me great respect for animators.
